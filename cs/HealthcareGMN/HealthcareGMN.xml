             Helper class that is both a demonstration and usable implementation of a
             check character pair generator and verifier for a GS1 GMN that is used for
             Regulated Healthcare medical devices that fall under the EU regulations EU
             MDR 2017/745 and EU IVDR 2017/746, herein referred to as a "healthcare GMN".
