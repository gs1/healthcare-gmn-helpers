HealthcareGMN JavaScript Helper Library
=======================================

This contains an official JavaScript helper library provided by GS1 for check
character pair generation and verification of a Global Model Number (GMN) when
it is used for Regulated Healthcare medical devices that fall under the EU
regulations EU MDR 2017/745 and EU IVDR 2017/746, specifically when a GMN is
used as the embodiment of a Basic UDI-DI.

**Note:** The Global Model Number is now universally defined and a new,
functionally-equivalent library is provided to which all previous users of this
library should migrate. [Please refer to this notice for further details](../README.md).
